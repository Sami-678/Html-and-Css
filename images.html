    <!-- * There are two ways to  show images -->
     <!-- 1. Download images and then show internal path in src attribute -->
     
       <img src="Image/Bugatti" alt="Bugatti Chiron">
 <!-- 2. Direct access image on internet  , by coping image address and then place in src attribute -->
  <img src="https://miro.medium.com/1*SOaG7oUviv1erzr0n1czlg.jpeg" alt="Ninja h2r" title = "Ninja h2r is the fastest bike">
<!-- 3. There are some internal style or inline css in that particular images like height and width but we can't apply in it as it is not a good practise -->
<!-- 
4. You can also use the title  attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image -->
